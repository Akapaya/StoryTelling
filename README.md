# Unity Project: StoryTelling (College Project)

Welcome to my Unity repository, where I share my project developed as part of my digital games college course.

## Project description

### StoryTelling
The player receives random options of rules that he must follow to write his story, letting the player choose which one to follow, in the sample video you first choose the title of the work, and receive 3 options of how the story should begin, the player chooses whichever one you prefer, you then receive 3 options of where the story should go, and again the player chooses where it will go, there are 20 rules that in the end, with creativity and randomness, the player can train his story construction.

# At the end he can publish his text and other players can read it and see which rules fell to the author of the text, and whether he followed the rules.
